# ODEMM: Scoping and Scoring Scripts within Mission Atlantic Project

This repository is a simplified version, adapted from https://github.com/PaulBouch/ODEMM_Celtic_Sea. 
It creates shiny horrendogram that shows relationships among ecological components, pressures and economic sectors.
It also creates exploratory analysis plots.
It is still under construction.
